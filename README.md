## Simon Game
Based on the Simon [electronic game]("https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Simon_(game)") of the late 70s made and distributed by Milton Bradley.

#### Game Rules
* A player is presented with a random series of button presses that the player must mimic.
* Each time the player inputs a series of button presses correctly, the computer displays the series of button presses but with an additional step.
* If the player presses the wrong button, they receive an error message, and must re-enter the sequence again.
* If the player follows all 20 steps correctly they win.
* The player can play in "brutal" mode where if they press a button press, the game restarts at a new random series of button presses.
